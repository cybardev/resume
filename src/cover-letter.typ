*Re: Application for <> position*

Dear Madam/Sir,

I am Sheikh Saad Abdullah, an international undergraduate student at Saint Mary's University. As a 3rd-year B.Sc. in Computing Science student, I am looking for co-op opportunities to expand my knowledge and apply my skills in a practical environment. With the utmost eagerness, I want to express my interest and passion for the Information Technology Intern position, which was suggested by my university Professors and Co-op Coordinator. 

As you will find on my resume, I have had a variety of experiences with many different roles in *Information Technology* and related fields - from my time at Eskasoni Immersion School as *Game Designer and Developer* to my time at Northwood Care as *Full-stack Web Developer*. I am looking to make the next step in my career by leveraging my Information Technology skills to create software that expands the limits of human progress.

During my time at the University, I learned programming languages like Java, C, and C++, and even tutored Java and Python in my 2nd year. Most courses required us to work individually, but my favourite courses - Software Engineering and Mobile App Development - had us work in groups to create a final project for real clients. For these projects, I had to rapidly familiarize myself with technologies like jQuery, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, AlpineJS, Bootstrap, etc. and collaborate with my fellow team members to timely deliver quality software. My ability to swiftly learn new technologies and create value for clients would surely prove useful in a customer-focused organization such as Sobeys.

Most of my programming journey has been with Python, starting in 2017. At first I only made simple scripts but over time I started creating things that were actually useful to me, like *ytpy* (#link("https://github.com/cybardev/ytpy")[github.com/cybardev/ytpy]) - which allowed me to stream music from the command-line, so I wouldn't have to leave my code editor. Around the same time, I started using Linux which allowed me to use my computer much more effectively. Bash was my primary shell at the time, so I learned some shell-scripting to automate processes and made fun scripts like *cutefetch* (#link("https://github.com/cybardev/cutefetch")[github.com/cybardev/cutefetch]) - which displays a cute little animal to the terminal with some system information. I am currently working on *schedule* (#link("https://github.com/cybardev/schedule")[github.com/cybardev/schedule]) - a ReactJS app that creates my class routine, given my course information for the current semester. Given my varied interests and eagerness to learn, I am sure I will fit right into the Sobeys team.

My GitHub (#link("https://github.com/cybardev")[github.com/cybardev]) and my website (#link("https://cybar.dev")[cybar.dev]) present a more detailed outlook on my projects and endeavours. I am confident that my diverse interests and experiences will make me an asset to the team. And while my resume provides a quick summary of my experiences, I am excited and eager to have the opportunity to show you in action how I can bring value to the company's needs, and work in an environment where my growth is nurtured and my contributions empower users.

Sincerely,\
Sheikh
